# Canine Club Invoicing System
A mobile-first web application I built for my wife's dog walking business. Built with [Go](https://go.dev) and [HTMX](https://htmx.org).

## üöÄ Deploying
To run the app in a docker container, you'll need to create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following environment variables:
```env
SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=john@example.com
SMTP_PASS=P@ssw0rd
FROM_NAME=John Doe
FROM_ADDRESS=4 Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey
FROM_CITY=London
ACCOUNT_NUMBER=12-3456-7890123-45
BASE_URL=http://invoices.example.com
```

I recommend using a docker-compose file to run the app. Here's an example:

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  invoices:
    image: ghcr.io/scottmckendry/ccinvoice:main
    container_name: invoices
    networks:
    - traefik
    volumes:
    - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
    - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    - ./db.sqlite3:/app/db.sqlite3
    - ./.env:/app/.env
    ports:
        3000:3000
    restart: unless-stopped
```

This will run the app on port 3000. I recommend using [Traefik](https://traefik.io) as a reverse proxy. Take a look at my [setup guide](https://scottmckendry.tech/posts/traefik-setup/) for more information.

> [!WARNING]\
> Do not expose the app to the internet without a reverse proxy running authentication middleware. The app does not have any authentication built in.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Development
To run the app locally, create a `.env` file matching the example above. Then use the docker-compose file in the root of the repository by running `docker compose up`. This will run the app on port 3000. You can then access the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

The project uses [air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air) for live reloading. To run the app locally without docker, run `air` in the root of the repository.
